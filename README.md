# Augmented Reality Shooting Game using Vuforia

Increased Reality Single Shot game using Unity 3D and Vuforia. Done together with Rodrigo Bueno.

HOW IT WORKS: The player holds a weapon in the real world and his movement is identified using markers. The objects (targets) are cubes, and the player can see them using the cell phone and a marker.
